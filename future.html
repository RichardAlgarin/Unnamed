<h1>Future of Cryptocurrency</h1>
<hr>
<body>
    <p> The future can never be predicted to one hundred percent accuricy.  Because of this it is hard to tell of Cryptocurrency is here to stay or not.
        The largest concern and why the priceing flucuates so much is that there is no regulation.  If nations wish to adopt digital forms of currency
        they have many challenges to face.  El Salvdor became the first nation in the world that reconizes Bitcoin as a national currency, and nations 
        such as Germany that reconize it as "Private Money" inorder to tax it.  There may soon be more countries that may start to make the cryptocurrency Bitcoin legal tender.
        The legalization of Bitcoin would sky rocket investments in more countries, advancing towards the real world.
        If nations start adopting Bitcoin as national currency then this would be the first time ever where no one has to worry about the exchange rate of currency
        from one nation to the other.  The aplication of Bitcoin to the national will provide another and efficient and safe way to pay for goods.
