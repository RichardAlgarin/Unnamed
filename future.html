<h1>Future of Cryptocurrency</h1>
<hr>
<body>
    <p> There may soon be more countries that may start to make the cryptocurrency Bitcoin legal tender.
        The legalization of Bitcoin would sky rocket investments in more countries, advancing towards the real world.
        It would also help anyone who has no other financial services. 
        Bitcoin will provide another and efficient way to pay for goods.
