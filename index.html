<h1>Crypto Currency</h1>

    <p>When someone hears people talk about crypto currency it is normal to be confused at first.  All forms of "crypto" are still new. 
    Normally when something new is all over the news there are two types of people.  Ones who do not like it and have no clue what it is. 
    And then there are ones who can see the potential of the newly emerging technology. </p>
