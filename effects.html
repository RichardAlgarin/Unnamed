    <p>Some of the positive outcomes consist of reducing the risk of scams and credit card fraud.
       Also, almost every cryptocurrency at the time of its launch, is released with a fixed amount. As the demand increases, its value will increase which will keeep up with the market and in the long run prevent inflation.
       In addition, this is a fast way to transfer funds, whether international or domestic in cryptocurrencies they are lightning-fast.
       The decentralization helps keep the currency monopoly free in order for no organization to determine the flow, and the value of the coin, which will keep it stable and secure, unlike fiat currencies whom are controlled by the government.

    <p>While there are positive outcomes to cryptocurrencies, there are also some negative effects to this currency. 
        Crytocurrency can be used for illegal transactions since the privacy and security of cryptocurrency transactions are high. It is difficult for the government to keep track of users data and transactions.
        Additionally, if any user loses the private key to their wallet, there unfortunately is no way of recovering this key. Therefore, data losses can cause financial losses.
        There is a no refund or cancellation policy, meaning, that if there is a dispute between concerning parties, or it is mistakenly sent elsewhere, the coin cannot be retrieved by the sender.
        Lastly, cryptocurrency exchanges are vulnerable to cyber attacks and scams.
